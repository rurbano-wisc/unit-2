        <h2>    The year 1980 was chosen as a starting point because it is around when the deregulation of oil prices began, arguably one of the best times where alternative energy sources could have been invested in. 
            With the second best time being now. As a result, years 1980-2015 shown below summarized by number of active oil wells for per state.</h2>

        <div class="column" style="background-color:lightblue;"><b>According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) the following states do not have active/producing Oil or Natural Gas Wells:</b><br>
            <br>Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Massachusetts, Maine, Minnesota, North Carolina, 
            New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wisconsin.<br>
            <br>This does not mean complete absence of any oil infrastructure for these states, all states have oil pipelines traversing through the countrysides and into the urban networks.</div>
        <div class="column1" style="background-color:lightgrey;"><b>Not featured here are an additional twelve states that have active oil production established prior to 1980.</b><br><br>  
            The three states that have not created additional oil wells are: <br>
            Alabama, Colorado, and Illinois.<br><br>States that have recently come online for oil extraction are: Michigan, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington. 
            <br><br>Toggle the refineries layer to see where oil is being sent to from oil producing states.<br></div>
        <div class="column2" style="background-color:lightblue;">Studies have reported associations between residential proximity to oil and gas operations 
            increasingly contributes to air pollution, water contamination, noise, psychosocial stress, and health risks.<br><br>
            Sulfur dioxide and benzene are two of the most common pollutants that effects the human body through breathing in contaminated air. Any person living near an oil refinery is susceptible to this type of exposure.
            <br><br> Even in areas where there has been discontinued oil infrastructure, these pose unseen issues often times.</div>
